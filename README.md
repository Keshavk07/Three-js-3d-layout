# 🌲 3D Interactive Forest Scene in React

This project is a 3D interactive nature scene built using **React**, **@react-three/fiber**, and **Three.js**. It features animated trees, blooming flowers, floating clouds, realistic mountains, and a user-controllable butterfly that moves through the environment.

## ✨ Features

- 🏔️ Procedural 3-layer mountains with a snowy peak
- 🌳 Animated tree with textured trunk, layered leaves, and subtle branch motion
- 🌼 Flowers that bloom and fade with time
- ☁️ Clouds that float and drop raindrops from a fixed height
- 🦋 A butterfly that you can move using your keyboard
- 🎮 Keyboard Controls:
  - `Arrow Up / Down / Left / Right`: Move butterfly along X and Y axes
  - `W` / `S`: Move butterfly forward and backward (Z-axis)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **@react-three/fiber** – React renderer for Three.js
- **@react-three/drei** – Useful helpers like `OrbitControls`
- **Three.js** – 3D rendering library
- **JavaScript** (ES6+)
